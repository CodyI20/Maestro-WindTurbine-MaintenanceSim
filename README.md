## About the project
The Maestro project team has developed a real-life robot which has the purpose of replacing the dangerous work wind turbine cleaners have to do. The public's reaction was initially negative towards robots taking the place of humans, however, the purpose of this VR project is to allow users experience both the cleaner's and the robot's point of view in hopes of changing the mentality and proving why it's much better to integrate robots into this workfield.
